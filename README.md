## how it works
We have a visual map with 9 posibilities. Each challenge is fully solved by tapping the six blocks of the sequence before the timeline (6 seconnds).

## configuration
<p>Add or remove levels using the `assets/L.txt` file by simply changin the 6 digits block.</p>
<p>To change messages text review `assets/M.txt` file.</p>

## features
